## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an alternate path to exploitation, taken by the CRS-generated POVs during CFE, as described below.

The author's description states that multiple steps are required to prove the exploit.  CRS-generated POVs do not appear to require multiple steps, with all overwrites occurring in one call to receive\_until, which overwrites the return address of its caller (play\_round), and loads the exploit code.

##Reference POV##
call eax from 08049796 in play\_round
Value in eax from receive:

    added backtrack START:0x8049772:mov eax,dword ptr [ecx+0xc] track addr: 0xbaaaae78, value 0xbaaaae6c : 4647f0a
    added backtrack:0x804a34b:mov byte ptr [edx+ecx],al : 3f095ac
    added backtrack:0x804a342:mov al,byte ptr [ebp-0x21] : 3f095a9
    added backtrack:0x804d3fc: follows kernel write of 0x16c to 0xbaaaade3 : 3f0959c

Receive of one byte into baaaade3 (receive\_until)

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804D3F6 receive+0x15
    08049DD4 main+0xF4
    0804D3A8 _start

Exploit code read in receive of one byte into baaaad53  (receive\_until)

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804D3F6 receive+0x15
    08048657 add_player+0xC7
    08049E2E main+0x14E
    0804D3A8 _start

Reference uses multiple steps, see the README.


##CodeJitsu vs CSDS, round 81 throw 1##

The POV add just one player, where the reference POV
requires three players to distribute shell code.

call eax from 8049796 in play\_round

    added backtrack START:0x8049772:mov eax,dword ptr [ecx+0xc] track addr: 0xbaaaae78, value 0xbaaaae6a : 1aef6a09
    added backtrack:0x804a34b:mov byte ptr [edx+ecx],al : 1a6480dd
    added backtrack:0x804a342:mov al,byte ptr [ebp-0x21] : 1a6480da
    added backtrack:0x804d401: follows kernel write of 0x16a to 0xbaaaade3 : 1a6480cd

Read for one byte into baaaade3

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804D3FB receive+0x15
    08049DD4 play_round+0xD94
    0804D3AD _start+0x5

exploit code read:

    added backtrack START:0xbaaaae6a:mov edi,0x440ee628 track addr: 0xbaaaae6a, value 0xee628bf : 1aef6a14
    added backtrack:0x804a34b:mov byte ptr [edx+ecx],al : 1a02632b
    added backtrack:0x804a342:mov al,byte ptr [ebp-0x21] : 1a026328
    added backtrack:0x804d401: follows kernel write of 0x1bf to 0xbaaaade3 : 1a02631b

Read of 1 bytes into baaaade3

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804D3FF receive+0x19
    08049DD4 play_round+0xD94
    0804D3AD _start+0x5


The CodeJitsu exploit code is just three instructions.
baaaae6a - ae74

A single call to receive\_until from play\_round achieves all of the necessary
memory corruption, contrary to the claim in the README that "...proving the vulnerability
requires multiple steps", and is thus hard to prove.


##DeepRed vs CSDS##

baaaae6d - e77

Looks similar to the CodeJitsu POV.
