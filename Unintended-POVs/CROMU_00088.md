## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an additional vulnerability, as described below.

The author describes the vulnerability as a buffer overflow resulting from many calls to allocate.  The only successful CRS-generated POV did not exploit that vulnerability.  Instead, it exploited a CB that simplifies guessing of magic page values.  The CB returns a message handle to the client that is generated by reading three and a half bytes from the magic page.  If the masked nibble in the magic page happens to be zero, then the handle is the four byte secret.

ShellPhish scored against all competitors using this technique, but only in round 64 in the ninth throw.

No other team had a successful POV.
