## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an alternate path to exploitation, taken by the CRS-generated POVs during CFE, as described below.

The coding bug in all exploits is the same, but the implications of that bug are broader than described by the author.  The bug is that calloc of a zero byte buffer is possible, where the buffer is intended to be 0xff + 1.  The reference POV requires careful reproduction of data structures stored in the heap to corrupt the control path.  Most CRS-generated POVs simply used the bug to transmit protected memory content with no control corruption.  ForAllSecure used it to cause calloc to return a block from the stack.

    added backtrack:0x804fd22: follows kernel write of 0x4187 to 0xb7fff0f4 : c0cb695

strcpy overwrites the return address.

    Subsequent call to RenameFile, yada yada see README, but, no need for all that.

##CSDS vs Disekt##
* Protected value is cef171f2
* "ce" is read from 4347c766
* at 0x804f1d2, which is part of the ListFiles operation.
* The listfiles operation should not contain magic page data.

The call chain at time of the magic page access is:

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804F1D2 rint+0xEE2
    0804DAD9 wrapper_output+0x349
    0804DE62 vsprintf+0x52
    0804DDF9 sprintf+0x29
    0804AD05 ListFiles+0x365
    0804861B HandleDir+0x3B
    08048DFF HandleRequest+0xAF
    0804920A FreeResponse+0x19A
    0804FCD3 _start+0x5

The result of the ListFiles is then transmitted from b7ffe054 as part of 0x390 write from 0xb7ffe004 which is just the output of the ListFiles function.

Just prior to the HandleRequest call, the ReceiveRequest function receives the client request, which uses CallocAndRead where the calloc of a zero length buffer occurs, allowing other heap blocks to be overwritten.  Here is the content of the address of the zero length buffer before the read:

    00 F1 FF B7 00 00 00 00  08 00 00 00 70 61 73 73  ............pass

    10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  3A 72 6F 6F 74 70 61 73  ........:rootpas

And after:

Pointers to filenames were overwritten with pointers to the magic page.  This seems a lot less sophisticated than basic heap corruption.

##ForAllSecure vs Disekt, round 6 throw 1##

Overwrite of return address of ReceiveRequest.
Occurs in receive, read of 0x41 bytes into baaaaf9c.
Call stack from receive:

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804FD21 allocate+0x15  (really receive)
    08048272 CallocAndRead+0x62
    08048511 ReceiveRequest+0x291
    00000000 MEMORY:saved_fp

The trick here is that the block allocated in CallocAndRead (above) is in stack space.  The previous call to CallocAndRead exploited a zero length block, and overwrote block meta-data so the next allocate would come from the stack.
