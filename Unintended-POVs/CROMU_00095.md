## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an additional vulnerability, as described below.

The vulnerability described by the author is a buffer overflow in a reproduction of the NetPathCanonicalize function of the Microsoft RPC Server.  This vulnerability was not exploited by CRS-generated POVs.  Instead, it appears the same malloc implementation error that led to the unintended POV for CROMU\_00097 was exploited here.  Two main reasons for this conclusion: malloc returns stack space; and the POV works against the reference patched service.

##Reference POV##
 Overwrite of return address in ConvertPathMacros.

 The buffer address (BAAAAF57) is returned by malloc.
 This address (less 4 bytes) comes from a receive call of 0x80 bytes into B7FFDF78.
