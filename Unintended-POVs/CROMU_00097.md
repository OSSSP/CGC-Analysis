## Post Event Analysis
Post event analysis identified an additional vulnerability, as described below.

The author describes the service as having a "heart-bleed" vulnerability.  But that is not exploited by CRS-generated POVs.  Instead, a call to receive in the receive\_fixed function overwrites the stack.   The msls\_receive\_msg calls receive\_fixed with a bad address returned from malloc -- that became part of the heap by a bad call to free, which itself appears to have resulted from twice freeing a message buffer.

Only ForAllSecure scored on this service, and their CRS-generated POV exploited this additional vulnerability.

The reference patch does not mitigate this additional vulnerability.

##Reference POV##

    Protected memory read in memcpy, called from msls_get_connection (804a7aa)
    Secret transmitted in 0x180 byte write from b7fffb8c (secret at b7fffc16).
    Transmit called from msls_send_msg+31d
    Length of transmit (number of bytes to send, thus the heart-bleed bug),  received from msls_receive_msg+0x22e


##ForAllSecure vs CodeJitsu, round 10 throw 1##
Overwrite occurs in receive, to ret pointer at baaaaaee8


Receive of 0x3b bytes into baaaeb3
In this state, IDA stack trace reports:

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804EB77 receive+0x15
    08048D9E sub_8048B70
    0804AF20 sub_804AEB0
    0804EB29 _start+0x5

After an uncall (and apply function signatures):

    Address  Function
    -------  --------
    0804DBDE receive_fixed+0x6E
    08048D9E msls_receive_msg+0x22E
    0804AF20 msls_set_cookie+0xF0 (Ida confused?  should be main)
    0804EB29 _start+0x5


In msls\_receive\_message,
the (2nd instance of) calloc  returns baaaaeb3.

###Heap link list corrupted?###
Receive of 0x40c bytes into b7fff330, includes value 0xbaaaaeb3 into b7fff33c.
Note that baaaaeb3 is the address returned by alloc.
Receive called from receive\_fixed at 804dbde, called from msls\_receive\_msg 8048d9e.
That receive buffer gotten from calloc, with the 0x40c size.
So, at this point, baaaaeb3 is just data in a heap allocated block.

    msls_destroy_msg (804944f) calls free with address baaaeb3.  (discovered via read breakpoint, running forward)

    msls_destory_msg called with b7fff2ec.  0x14 is added to that to get b7fff330 (which contains
baaaaeb3), which is freed.

    b7fff2ec is read from baaaafa4, tracked...

Before the above call to msls\_destroy\_msg, free is called for b7fff2ec by msls\_destroy\_msg (80494ec)
Someone is destroying a message that was already freed?
Or is perhaps receive/calloc called in between the calls to destroy?
