CSV of PoVs submitted by a team for which they received no feedback.

```
round,csid,thrower,defender,throw,pov_type
```

This file was generated by comparing PoVs negotiated by a team with the PoV feedback the team received from the CGC infrastructure.
The breakdown of missing PoVs by team is:
```
team 1 missing 67111
team 2 missing 27082
team 4 missing 506
team 5 missing 641
team 6 missing 830
team 7 missing 755
```
The counts include all throws.  In many cases, teams received feedback for a subset of the throws they made against a service in a round.  It appears that the CGC Archive at Lungetech does not link to a PoV in cases where none of the throws generated feedback.

None of these PoVs were successful.  However, teams may have responded differenty had they received explicit feedback regarding the failure of PoVs.
