# CGC-Analysis
Cyber Grand Challenge Final Event analysis of exploited vulnerabilities and team defenses.
Results of analysis of CGC CFE artifacts, primarily performed using the CGC Monitor.
A demonstration of the analysis features of the CGC Monitor can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpH_PZhwAL0
This repo includes analysis results and observations on how CRSes behaved during CFE.

Artifacts from the CGC, including game infrastructure logs, competitor submissions, and reverse-execution traces of 
successful exploits generated by the CGC Monitor can be found at http://www.lungetech.com/2017/04/24/cgc-corpus/.
